# Envoy OpenSSL Extensions

The Envoy OpenSSL Extensions project hosts extensions for building
[Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) purely with OpenSSL.

OpenSSL is supported by providing a compatiblity library and a set of TLS related classes that track upstream functionality using OpenSSL rather than BoringSSL.
